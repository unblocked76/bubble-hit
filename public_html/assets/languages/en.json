The more bubbles you take down with a single shot, the more points you'll score. If you fail to clear any bubbles, you'll receive a foul. After a several fouls, a new line of bubbles will appear at the top of the board. The game will end either when you've cleared the board or the bubbles have reached the bottom of the board. ",
